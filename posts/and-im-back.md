After a long hiatus, I've decided to write a blog entry.  Lots of things have happened since the last time I posted.  I've got a new job, graduated from college, moved to a new apartment, and dealt with lots of family drama.  With all of that out of the way, I hope to post more often (no promises).


By the way, does anyone actually read this?!?
