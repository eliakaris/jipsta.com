I recently started using <a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/">JungleDisk</a> to backup all of my documents, pictures, music, and code.  How JungleDisk works is really cool. The first thing that you do is create an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261">Amazon S3 storage account</a>, which is known as one of the most reliable online storage services available. Then you setup <a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/">Jungle Disk</a> on your computer, which adds a drag-and-drop interface for managing the encrypted files on your Amazon S3 account. You can even schedule backups of important files and directories on your computer to make sure the data stored on the Amazon S3 servers is always up-to-date.

So why is Amazon S3 so nice?  Most people will say that it's their pricing model.  Instead of having a tiered structure for plans (ex. 20GB for $5/month) you pay only for what you use. But the real reason, for me, is their API.  Yeah, I know, not many people care about APIs, but it's a big deal for me.

So what has me all excited about Amazon's S3 API?  It has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful </a>interface!  Yes, that's right!  I can connect to, read, download, and modify my data anyway I wish with just HTTP.  I don't have to worry about implementing a bloated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service#Additional_specifications.2C_WS-.2A">WS-* stack</a> to access my data.  GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE mixed with a little XML is all I need.

I think the whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a> appeal for me is a return to the basics.  Over the years, the web has become far too complex and over engineered.  REST means much more than <a href="http://www.itcrossing.com/Blog/tabid/103/EntryID/79/Default.aspx">clean URLs</a>, or <a href="http://www.itcrossing.com/Blog/tabid/103/EntryID/79/Default.aspx">search engine optimization</a>.

First things first.  The REST design pattern is meant for web services, not strictly the human readable web.  REST is a design philosophy for computer to computer interaction.  If we never had to expose our data
