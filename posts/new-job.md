Starting the last week of November I will start work at Microsoft.  The team I'm joining specialized in web development (which is right up my alley).  I simply can't wait!  To be around some of the world's smartest programmers, engineers, and designers is very exciting!<br />

November 16th is my last day at PaperWise, the next week is Thanksgiving, then I start the new job the following Monday.   That does not give me much time to pack and move.  I'll just barley step off the plane before I have to start work.   Anyway, that's it for now.  Stay tuned for more.<br />
