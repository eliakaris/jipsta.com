<img align="left" alt="GettingThingsDone2.gif" src="http://jipsta.files.wordpress.com/GettingThingsDone2.gif" />So I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280/002-9630333-7482436?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Getting Things Done</a> by David Allen, and I've found it to be very inspiring.   The reason I got this book is because I'm a huge procrastinator.  When the end of the school semester draws near, I panic.  I get sooo stressed out and I can't handle it.

The book suggests making to-do lists for everything and having a calendar nearby at all times.  This is a perfect opportunity  to dust off my PDA and put it to good use.   I honestly think that I'll "get things done" for the next two weeks and then go back to my old ways.  I hope I'm wrong; only time will tell.
