I completed the quintessential "Hello, World!" application for web developers, my own blog engine. The blog engine utilizes [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) and [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/)

![Django](http://jipsta.com/img/django-logo.png)

Features include:

* Basic Creation, Reading, Updating, and Deletion (CRUD) functionality
* Comments
* Standard blog URL design: /blog/[year]/[month]/[day]/[article]/
* Spam filtering
