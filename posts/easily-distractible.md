Does anyone else have this problem?  When you start to do something, e.g., writing a blog entry, you get distracted by something completely ridiculous. Here's the internal thought process that lead to this entry:

* It has been a really long time since I've written.  
* Actually, I think I should spend some time cleaning up this blog's CSS.
* Naaa, I really need to write something.
* OOOOoo!!  I should write about how I like Microsoft or Seattle or something.
* What am I thinking??  I can't write at home, it's too distracting!  I need to go to the coffee shop.
* *drives to the coffee shop*
* Crap.  Should I order coffee?  It's already 7:45pm, I don't want to be awake all night. 
* Hmmm... should I write my blog entry online, with TextMate, or something else.   *spent 10 minutes looking at various Mac editors before deciding on TextMate*
* What should I write about?  My original topic will take me forever to write, my second idea sucks, hmmm....  *spent 15 minutes outlining my thoughts*
* Looked at some interesting mind mapping software.  
* Found myself on the [OmniGraffle website](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/), which lead me to [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/).
* Spent some time looking at [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/), because I'm a non-practicing [GTD nerd](http://jipsta.com/blog/2006/01/13/getting-things-done/).
* Pulled myself back together, opened up TextMate.
* Decided that I should write about distractions.
