Way back in the day, I used to frequent [digg](http://digg.com) for my daily dose of tech news and random interesting links. But times changed. Sites like [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Reddit](http://reddit.com) came along and stole my attention. Sooner or later, I stopped visiting [Digg](http://digg.com) all together. I think the end came sometime near the [final DiggNation episode](http://revision3.com/diggnation/) and the [botched digg.com v4 update](http://searchengineland.com/digg-v4-how-to-successfully-kill-a-community-50450). After that, I just didn't care anymore. Digg was dead.

But now I'm back.

Digg is now under new management, the site has been dramatically simplified, and now they're sporting [an all new RSS reader](http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader). If you're a dinosaur like me and still read RSS feeds, check out [Digg Reader](http://digg.com/reader). It's great!
