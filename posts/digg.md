Back in the day, I frequented [digg.com](http://digg.com) for my daily dose of tech news and interesting links. As time went on, my interest in Digg faded. Sites like [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Reddit](http://reddit.com) came along and completely changed the way I consume news.

But now I'm back.

I checked it out the other day and was plesently surprised. The site has been dramatically simplified and now they're sporting [an all new RSS reader](http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader).

The new site is great! I may become a digg user once again.
