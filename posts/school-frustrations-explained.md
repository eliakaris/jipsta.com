The past two semesters, I've become increasingly frustrated with college. The main reasons being:
<ul>
	<li>Senioritis</li>
	<li>I'd rather be programming my      own stuff at work or on my own</li>
	<li>I took too many hours and      worked too much (I was defiantly burnt out last year)</li>
	<li>Homework assignments were not      interesting</li>
</ul>
In a <a href="http://jipsta.wordpress.com/2006/02/17/an-update">previous blog entry</a>, I ranted about my networking teacher and how I didn't like the class. Well, I'm going to retract many of the comments I made. Tonight I reread that post and realized that I shouldn't have been so harsh. The teacher is new and is actually doing a good job. She has really surprised me.<br />

On my <a href="http://jipsta.wordpress.com/2006/02/17/an-update">previous post</a>, Jerry commented,<em>"Hmmm… I had a two students in CS130 last semester that were complete opposites in their attitude toward the class. Both have skills way beyond the scope of the class however, one got an ‘A’ and the other a ‘F’. At one point the student who failed emailed me and basiclly tried to claim that he wasn’t doing any of the assignments or attending class because none of the material was interesting or challenging to him. The student who got the ‘A’ never complained about the class and always went way above and beyond the assignments. He made the most of his sitution."</em><br />

In a way, I can kind of see the second student's point.  Not everyone cares about grades; it's not a motivating factor. I wish I could just sit in class and absorb the information and not have to do any homework.<br />
