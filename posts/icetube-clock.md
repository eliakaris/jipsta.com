I purchased the <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/icetube/index.html">Ice Tube Clock kit</a> from <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a> a while back. How could I pass up building a retro looking clock made from a rare Russian display tube?!? The kit was fantastic and a lot of fun to build, the finished product is now beaming the time proudly on my desk at work.
