Most of the &quot;popular&quot; websites in Springfield, Missouri are in need of serious help. With all of the buzz about Web 2.0 in the air, Springfield is still struggling to keep up with Web .01. These sites are a shining example of the <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9605a.html" title="Top 10 Mistakes in Web Design">original top ten mistakes in web design</a>, published <b>over 10 years ago</b>.<br />

On top of that, all of these sites have far too many ads!   Why do people want their websites to look like NASCAR vehicles?<br />

<ul>
<li class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.ky3.com" title="KY3">ky3.com</a> - This site is simply      painful to look at. It makes my eyes bleed.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.news-leader.com" title="News-Leader">news-leader.com</a> - Their goal is      to squeeze as much crap and advertising in one page as they possible can.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.bestof417.com/" title="Best of 417">bestof417.com</a> - Is this a joke?      Seriously. WTF?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.kolr10.com" title="kolr10.com">kolr10.com</a> - The best way to cheapen      your website is to cram as many hideous ads on the main page as possible.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.417today.com" title="417today">417today.com</a> - Yea! Another bland,      pointless, cookie-cutter <a href="http://www.postnuke.com/" title="postnuke">postnuke</a> website!      They even managed to remove all the postnuke credits and promote their      site like they actually developed it themselves! At least they&#39;re trendy.      I should rename my blog to 417jipsta.com.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.thexdegree.com" title="thexdegree.com">thexdegree.com</a> - I saved the <s>best</s>      worst for last. The X Degree is a site my ex-coworker created to contend      with myspace, thefacebook, xanga, and the rest. His site manages to break      EVERY web design rule in the book. He actually quit his decent full-time      job to pursue promoting thexdegree.com full time.</li>
