I just watched the latest <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel9</a> <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=146749">interview</a> with the Microsoft ClearType team. Strangely, I enjoyed every minute of it. I never realized I would be so fascinated by an hour long video about typography. I had no idea of what goes on behind the senses when fonts are rendered to the screen.<br />

I can honestly say that I've never given ClearType a chance. I've guess I've gotten used to the crappy rendering I've grown up with. So now I'm going to give it a try. I turned ClearType on and tweaked it to my liking (with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypePowerToy.mspx">ClearType PowerToy</a>).<br />

The new font, Consolas, that ships with Vista seems very cool.Â   A good monospaced typeface like Consolas is important because lengthy on-screen reading while programming can quickly tire the eyes.<br />

Here is a link to an <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=47&amp;aid=78683">article</a> that discusses all of the new fonts included with Windows Vista.  If you still can't get enough typography, I suggest checking out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/">fontblog</a>.
