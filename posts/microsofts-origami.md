Give me a break.   The Lifestyle PC?  WTF?  Come on Microsoft, can't you come up with a better marketing slogan?<br />

With no keyboard and no phone, I won't be purchasing my Lifestyle PC anytime soon.<br />

Why can't anyone make a decent phone/camera/pda/ipod device??  I think that's what we're all waiting for.<br />
