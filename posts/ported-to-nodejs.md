I recently had the itch to write a blog entry. I sat down, wrote a few sentences, then proceeded to publish my work. I quickly discovered that I had no idea how to update this damn thing. I completely forgot. After all, it has been [almost two years](http://jipsta.com/wacky-javascript-regexp-global-modifier) since my last entry and [nearly five years](http://jipsta.com/django-blog-engine) since I wrote the blog engine.

What does one do in this situation? Rewrite! This time around, I rewrote everything in [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org/) and completely ditched the database. Now all I have to do [write some markdown](https://github.com/jpcummins/jipsta.com/tree/master/posts) and update [entries.json](https://github.com/jpcummins/jipsta.com/blob/master/entries.json). A nice benefit to the flat file approach and hosting on [GitHub](http://github.com) is that my blog entries are nice and readable on their site.

Here's the code: [https://github.com/jpcummins/jipsta.com](https://github.com/jpcummins/jipsta.com)
