I have just been invited to this year's most grand social event.

> Why Hello,
> 
> I recently became the proud owner of the [Dyson AM03 Air Multiplier](http://www.dyson.com/store/productFan.asp?product=AM03-SILSIL), the Cadillac of fans.  As I'm sure you are all aware being the owner of a Dyson AM03 Air Multiplier comes with certain expectations;  I am now a member of an elite group and am expected to act as such.  To celebrate my advance up the social ladder, and to make my transition complete, I have decided to throw a classy party with classy people.
